        <p>Since 2007, I have been working in the field of compulsory health insurance, the work is related to updating data on insured persons in the software product. execution of all necessary requests, loading and unloading of data, etc.
            I have no experience in programming, but I graduated from web developer school on maternity leave. I really want to change my profession, because this industry is interesting to me. However, after giving birth, I need to repeat what I learned, so I decided to take the training again.
